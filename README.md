# Justin-Holderman-Challenge-1
Horiseon Marketing agency Search engine optimization
This project included refactoring HTML and CSS code that did not comply with acessability standards.
I went through and changed all "div"s to semantic tags that follow a logical progression through the page; i.e. Header, Section, Aside, Footer.
I implemented alt tags for all images within the file so that screen readers have an accurate description of all images.
I published the site to my github Pages.
